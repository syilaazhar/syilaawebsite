<p>My name is Nurul Syilatulnaim Binti Azhar and I'm 20 years old. Most of my 
friend call me Syila but my family call me Lala. I was born on 13th April 2000 
at Hospital Kulim, Kedah. I have 4 siblings including me, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. 
I'm the third one in the family. I live in Kulim, Kedah. I am a fresh diploma graduate 
from Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) in the Information Management course. The strength 
I have is that I am a fast learner and can work well in groups. I can also communicate well 
by being able to impress customers and attract their interest. You can read more about

<td bgcolor="#F9966B"><p><b>What people thought about me</b></p>

<p>Some people say that I’m weird and eccentric, and they’re probably right. 
But what’s life without a little weirdness, no? After all, where’s the fun in living a normal life?
Anyways, I suck at writing about myself, you’ll probably learn more about me through my website.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFC2"><p><b>About The Website</b></p>

<p>Syila's website started off in December 2020 as my personal website. It changed from being an online diary of 
my life to being a medium for me to share my memories and experiences with people.
This website is also part of the assignment for IMD311 subject.</p>

<p>Well, singing can relieve stress. Hopefully you can enjoy my singing. :)</p>
