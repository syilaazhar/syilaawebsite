and I went on holiday to Kuala Terengganu. The atmosphere is different from the local 
community tradition which is of course different from the community tradition where I add my excitement to continue exploring Kuala Terengganu.</p>

<p>The first destination that our family chose after relaxing for a while at the hotel is of course Pantai Penarik which is the most popular 
destination on Kuala Terengganu. The beauty of Pantai Penarik is difficult to express in words. Me, mom and sister did not miss 
the opportunity to take pictures here. The person who is most happy about our visit to this beach is of course my brother, Adam. 
He had a lot of fun bathing here with my dad. After a tiring bath on the beach, we decided to head back to the hotel to enjoy dinner.</p>

<p><img src="Images/terengganu1.jpg" alt="picture of terengganu" align="left" border="1">On the second day, we were taken by our tour guide, Pak Cik Rashid, around the island. My family and I have also been taken to visit 
interesting and historical places at Kuala Terengganu. Among the places we have visited are Pantai Batu Buruk, Tengku Zaharah Mosque, Istana Maziah, Wanisma Craft 
and Trading, trip to Pulau Redang, Kraftangan Malaysia and finally the must-visit destination when at Kuala Terengganu which is Crystal Mosque. 
After a tiring visit to these places, we were taken by him to dinner. On the last day here, my family and I visited one of the shopping malls 
located at Jalan Bandar, Kuala Terengganu which is known throughout the country. We have spent time buying a variety of souvenirs such as chocolates, souvenier and various dishes for family members who are unable to participate in this tour.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the wonderful memories and experiences that I have experienced while visiting here will be a memorabilia that will always be in my mind.</p>
